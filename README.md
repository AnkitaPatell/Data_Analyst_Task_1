## Tasks Performed

1. **Handled Missing Values**  
   - Identified using `.isnull()` in pandas  
   - Filled or removed based on context (e.g., dropping rows with missing `Income`)

2. **Removed Duplicates** 
   - Used `.duplicated()` in pandas to identify the duplicated rows 
   - Used `.drop_duplicates()` in pandas and "Remove Duplicates" in Excel

3. **Standardized Text Formats**  
   - Used unique() function of pandas to check for the inconsistently in the column values.
   - Cleaned values in categorical fields wherever required.
   - Ensured consistent case and spacing 
   
4. **Converted Dates**  
   - Standardized date columns (e.g., `Dt_Customer`) to `dd-mm-yyyy` format using `pd.to_datetime()`

5. **Renamed Column Headers**  
   - Renamed column name from 'Dt_Customer' to 'Cust_Enroll_Date' for better understanding
   - Replaced column name from 'Status_Marital' to 'Marital_Status'

6. **Fixed Data Types** 
   - Used info() and dtype functions of  pandas to check datatypes
   - Ensured numerical columns are `int` or `float`  
   - Converted date columns to `datetime64[ns]`
